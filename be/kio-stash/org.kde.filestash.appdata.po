"Selecting multiple files in any file manager for copying and pasting has"
" never been a pleasant experience, especially if the files are in a"
" non-continuous order. Often, when selecting files using Ctrl+A or the"
" selection tool, we find that we need to select only a subset of the required"
" files we have selected. This leads to the unwieldy operation of removing"
" files from our selection. Of course, the common workaround is to create a"
" new folder and to put all the items in this folder prior to copying, but"
" this is a very inefficient and very slow process if large files need to be"
" copied. Moreover Ctrl+Click requires fine motor skills to not lose the"
" entire selection of files."

"This is project has a novel solution to this problem. This adds virtual"
" folder support in all KIO applications, where the links to files and folders"
" can be temporarily saved for a session. The files and folders are \"staged\""
" on this virtual folder. Files can be added to this by using all the regular"
" file management operations such as Move, Copy and Paste, or by drag and"
" drop. Hence, complex file operations such as moving files across many"
" devices can be made easy by staging the operation before performing it."
